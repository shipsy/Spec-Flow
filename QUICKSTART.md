# Spec-Flow Quick Start

Get Spec-Flow running in your project in **5 minutes**.

## Prerequisites

✅ **Git 2.39+** | ✅ **PowerShell 7.3+** | ✅ **Python 3.10+** | ✅ **Claude Code**

Not sure? Run the prerequisite checker after installation (Step 3).

---

## Installation

### Option 1: NPM (Recommended - Fastest)

Install Spec-Flow with a single command using npx:

```bash
# Initialize in current directory (interactive wizard)
npx spec-flow init

# Or specify target directory
npx spec-flow init --target ./my-project

# Non-interactive mode (uses defaults)
npx spec-flow init --non-interactive
```

**What happens:**

- ✅ Detects your project type (Next.js, React, API, etc.)
- ✅ Installs `.claude/`, `.spec-flow/`, and `CLAUDE.md`
- ✅ Initializes memory files with default values
- ✅ Validates prerequisites

**Update existing installation:**

```bash
npx spec-flow update
```

### Option 2: Manual Installation (Clone Repository)

If you prefer to clone the repository first:

#### Step 1: Clone Spec-Flow Repository

```bash
# Clone to a workspace directory (not inside your project)
cd ~/projects  # or C:\Projects on Windows
git clone https://github.com/shipsy/Spec-Flow.git
cd Spec-Flow
```

#### Step 2: Run the Installation Wizard

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
# Interactive wizard
powershell -File .spec-flow/scripts/powershell/install-wizard.ps1

# Or specify target directory
powershell -File .spec-flow/scripts/powershell/install-wizard.ps1 -TargetDir ../my-project
```

**macOS/Linux (Bash):**

```bash
# Interactive wizard
./.spec-flow/scripts/bash/install-wizard.sh

# Or\spec-flow target directory
./.spec-flow/scripts/bash/install-wizard.sh --target-dir ../my-project
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation (Both Methods)

The installer runs checks automatically, but you can verify manually:

**Windows:**

```powershell
cd /path/to/your/project
pwsh -File .spec-flow/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1
```

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
./.spec-flow/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh
```

Expected output:

```
✅ Git 2.39+ installed
✅ PowerShell 7.3+ installed
✅ Python 3.10+ installed
✅ Claude Code accessible
```

If any checks fail, see [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md) for troubleshooting.

## Let Claude Code Set Up Your Project

Instead of manually editing files, let Claude Code's interactive commands configure your project with guided Q&A.

### Recommended Setup (Optional but Powerful)

Open Claude Code in your project directory and run these commands:

#### 1. Define Your Engineering Standards (Optional)

```
/constitution
```

Claude will interactively help you:

- Set project type (Web App, API, Mobile, CLI, etc.)
- Define test coverage requirements (50%, 70%, 80%, 90%)
- Configure performance targets (API response times, page load speeds)
- Set accessibility standards (WCAG Level A, AA, AAA)
- Add custom principles specific to your project

**Why?** Your constitution becomes the Single Source of Truth for all feature development. Every spec, plan, and review references these standards.

**Skip if:** You want to start with defaults (80% coverage, <200ms API, <2s page load, WCAG AA)

#### 2. Plan Your Feature Roadmap (Optional)

```
/roadmap
```

Claude will guide you through:

- Adding feature ideas to your backlog
- ICE scoring (Impact × Confidence ÷ Effort) for prioritization
- Organizing features: Backlog → Next → In Progress → Shipped

**Example interaction:**

```
You: /roadmap
Claude: Let's build your product roadmap. What feature would you like to add?

You: Add dark mode toggle
Claude: Great! Let me score this feature...
  - Impact (1-5): How much value for users? → 4
  - Effort (1-5): Implementation complexity? → 2
  - Confidence (0-1): Estimate certainty? → 0.9
  - ICE Score: (4 × 0.9) ÷ 2 = 1.8

✓ Added to "Next" (high priority). Ready to spec it out?
```

**Why?** Prioritized roadmap = focused development. ICE scoring prevents "urgency bias" and helps you ship high-impact features first.

**Skip if:** You have one clear feature to build and don't need prioritization

#### 3. Configure Your Workflow Preferences (Optional)

```
/init-preferences
```

Claude will guide you through 8 quick questions to customize command defaults:

- `/epic` default mode (interactive vs auto)
- `/tasks` default mode (standard vs UI-first)
- `/init-project` defaults (interactive vs CI, include design system)
- `/run-prompt` execution strategy (auto-detect, parallel, sequential)
- UI preferences (show usage stats, highlight last-used options)

**Example interaction:**

```
You: /init-preferences
Claude: What default mode should /epic use?
  1. Interactive (pause at reviews) - recommended for new users
  2. Auto (skip prompts) - recommended for experienced users

You: [Select option 1]
Claude: ✓ /epic will default to interactive mode
```

**Why?** No more remembering flags! Set your preferences once, and commands adapt to your workflow. The system also learns from your usage over time.

**Skip if:** You're fine with defaults (interactive mode, standard tasks, auto-detect strategy)

**How it works:**

- **Config file**: Set once, use forever (`.spec-flow/config/user-preferences.yaml`)
- **Learning system**: Commands remember your choices and suggest them
- **Override anytime**: Flags like `--auto` always override preferences

### Configure Claude Code Permissions (Required)

The installer creates `.claude/settings.local.json` with your project path. Review permissions:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Read(/absolute/path/to/your/project)",
      "Write(/absolute/path/to/your/project)",
      "Edit(/absolute/path/to/your/project)",
      "Bash(/absolute/path/to/your/project)"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Important**: Restart Claude Code after updating settings.

## Your First Feature

### 1. Build Your Roadmap

Open Claude Code in your project directory and run:

```
/roadmap
```

Claude will help you:

- Add feature ideas to `.spec-flow/memory/roadmap.md`
- Prioritize using ICE scoring (Impact × Confidence ÷ Effort)
- Organize features: Backlog → Next → In Progress → Shipped

**Example interaction:**

```
You: /roadmap
Claude: Let's build your product roadmap. What feature would you like to add?

You: Add dark mode toggle
Claude: Great! Let me gather some details...
  - Impact (1-5): 4 (users frequently request this)
  - Effort (1-5): 2 (1-2 days)
  - Confidence (0-1): 0.9 (clear requirements)
  - ICE Score: 1.8

Added to roadmap under "Next". Ready to spec it out?
```

### 2. Create a Specification

Once you have a prioritized feature, create its spec:

```
/feature "dark-mode-toggle"
```

This creates `specs/001-dark-mode-toggle/` with:

- `spec.md` - Full specification (requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria)
- `NOTES.md` - Decision log (tracks changes, blockers, pivots)
- `visuals/README.md` - UI/UX references

### 3. Run the Workflow

Use `/feature` to automate the full workflow with manual gates:

```
/feature "dark-mode-toggle"
```

The workflow progresses through phases:

```
/feature → /clarify → /plan → /tasks → /validate → /implement →
/optimize → /ship-staging → /validate-staging (manual) → /ship-prod
```

**Manual Gate**:

- `/validate-staging` - You test on staging before production promotion

Or run commands individually:

```
/plan         # Phase 1: Create implementation plan
/tasks        # Phase 2: Break into 20-30 tasks
/implement    # Phase 4: Execute tasks
/optimize     # Phase 5: Code review + performance checks
```

### "Permission denied" (macOS/Linux)

Make scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x .spec-flow/scripts/bash/*.sh
```

### "Claude Code not accessible"

1. Verify Claude Code is running
2. Check `.claude/settings.local.json` has correct paths
3. Restart Claude Code

### Settings not taking effect

Claude Code caches settings. After editing `.claude/settings.local.json`, restart Claude Code completely.

## Quick Reference

### Core Commands

| Command | Purpose | Common Flags |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `/init-preferences` | Configure workflow defaults (one-time setup) | `--reset` |
| `/roadmap` | Manage feature backlog with ICE scoring | |
| `/feature "name"` | Create specification and run workflow | |
| `/epic "goal"` | Multi-sprint complex work | `--auto`, `--interactive`, `--no-input` |
| `/plan` | Generate implementation plan | |
| `/tasks` | Break plan into 20-30 actionable tasks | `--ui-first`, `--standard` |
| `/implement` | Execute implementation tasks | |
| `/optimize` | Code review, performance, accessibility checks | |
| `/ship-staging` | Deploy to staging | |
| `/validate-staging` | Manual staging validation gate | |
| `/ship-prod` | Deploy to production | |

### Preference System

Your preferences control default behavior. Set once with `/init-preferences`:

**No preferences configured:**

```bash
/epic "add auth"
→ Prompts: "Run in auto or interactive mode?"
```

**With preferences configured:**

```bash
/epic "add auth"
→ Runs in your preferred mode automatically
```

**Override with flags:**

```bash
/epic "add auth" --auto
→ Always uses auto mode regardless of preferences
```

**Pro tips**:

- Run `/init-preferences` once to set your workflow defaults
- Commands learn from your choices (e.g., "You used auto mode 8/10 times")
- Use flags (`--auto`, `--ui-first`, etc.) to override preferences
- Use `/feature "feature-name"` to automate progression with manual gate at staging validation
- Use `/feature continue` to resume after manual validation or fixing issues
- Use `--no-input` flag for CI/CD automation (disables all prompts)
