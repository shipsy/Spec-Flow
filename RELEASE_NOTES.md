## v1.7.0 (2025-10-16)

### 🎯 Major Feature: Unified Task Status Tracking System

**Problem Solved:**
The `/implement` command had unreliable task completion tracking due to manual updates by agents. Tasks were tracked in two disconnected systems (tasks.md checkboxes and NOTES.md completion markers), leading to:

- Agents forgetting to update status (~50% miss rate)
- Desynchronization between tasks.md and NOTES.md
- False negative completion status
- Inconsistent formatting

**Solution Implemented:**
Created a unified, atomic task status tracking system using the enhanced task-tracker.ps1 script as the single source of truth.

### 📦 New Components

#### 1. Enhanced task-tracker.ps1 (`.spec-flow/scripts/powershell/task-tracker.ps1`)

**New Actions:**

- `mark-done-with-notes` - Atomically update both tasks.md and NOTES.md
- `mark-failed` - Log task failures to error-log.md
- `sync-status` - Migrate existing features (tasks.md → NOTES.md)

**New Functions:**

```powershell
Update-TaskCompletionAtomic    # Atomic updates with evidence tracking
Mark-TaskFailed                # Structured error logging
Sync-TaskStatus                # Migration utility
Get-NotesFile, Get-ErrorLogFile # Helper functions
```

**New Parameters:**

- `-Evidence` - Test execution evidence (e.g., "pytest: 25/25 passing")
- `-Coverage` - Coverage delta (e.g., "92% (+8%)")
- `-CommitHash` - Git commit for traceability
- `-ErrorMessage` - Detailed failure description

#### 2. Updated /implement Command (`.claude/commands/implement.md`)

**Changes:**

- Task-tracker initialization after feature directory loading
- Replace manual NOTES.md validation with task-tracker status queries
- Updated agent prompt templates to require task-tracker usage
- New "TASK STATUS UPDATES (MANDATORY)" section with examples
- Fallback to manual NOTES.md check if task-tracker unavailable

**Agent Prompt Template:**

```bash
.spec-flow/scripts/bash/task-tracker.sh mark-done-with-notes \
  -TaskId "TXXX" \
  -Notes "Implementation summary" \
  -Evidence "pytest: NN/NN passing" \
  -Coverage "NN% line (+ΔΔ%)" \
  -CommitHash "$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)" \
  -FeatureDir "$FEATURE_DIR"
```

#### 3. Updated Agent Briefs (4 files)

**Files Modified:**

- `.claude/agents/backend-dev.md`
- `.claude/agents/frontend-dev.md`
- `.claude/agents/qa-test.md`
- `.claude/agents/database-architect.md`

**New Section Added:** "Task Completion Protocol"

- Step-by-step completion workflow
- Task-tracker usage examples
- Failure handling instructions
- Domain-specific evidence requirements

#### 4. Updated /analyze Command (`.claude/commands/analyze.md`)

**New Section:** "TASK STATUS CONSISTENCY CHECK"

- Validates tasks.md ↔ NOTES.md synchronization
- Uses task-tracker validate action
- Reports inconsistencies as medium-priority issues
- Provides sync command for fixes

#### 5. Migration Script (`.spec-flow/scripts/bash/migrate-task-status.sh`)

**Features:**

- Scans all feature directories in specs/
- Interactive or batch mode (--all flag)
- Dry-run preview (--dry-run flag)
- Syncs completed tasks from tasks.md to NOTES.md
- Summary report with sync counts

### 🎯 Key Benefits

## v1.6.3 (2025-10-16)

### 🛠️ Code Quality Improvements

#### Resolved All Shellcheck Warnings in Bash Scripts

**Changes:**
Fixed all code quality issues identified by shellcheck static analysis tool in bash scripts.

**Issues Fixed:**

1. **SC2162 (info)**: `read` without `-r` will mangle backslashes

   - Added `-r` flag to all `read` commands
   - Prevents unexpected behavior with backslash escaping
   - Affected: roadmap-manager.sh (1 fix), version-manager.sh (5 fixes)

2. **SC2125 (warning)**: Brace expansions and globs are literal in assignments

   - Changed glob pattern assignment to use `find` command
   - Before: `local ship_report="$feature_dir"/*-ship-report.md`
   - After: `ship_report=$(find "$feature_dir" -name "*-ship-report.md" -type f | head -1)`
   - Location: version-manager.sh line 67

3. **SC2181 (style)**: Check exit code directly, not indirectly with `$?`
   - Changed to direct command check in if statement
   - Before: `current_version=$(get_current_version); if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then`
   - After: `if ! current_version=$(get_current_version); then`
   - Location: version-manager.sh line 103-105

## v1.6.2 (2025-10-16)

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix

#### Fixed EPERM Errors on Windows During Updates

**Problem:**
The update command was failing on Windows with `EPERM: operation not permitted` errors when trying to back up `node_modules`, especially in pnpm projects that use symlinks extensively. On Windows, creating symlinks requires administrator privileges, causing the backup/restore operations to fail catastrophically:

```bash
✖ Update failed
✗ Update error: EPERM: operation not permitted, symlink
  'node_modules\.pnpm\concurrently@9.2.1\node_modules\concurrently' ->
  'node_modules-backup-2025-10-16T18-33-03\concurrently'
```

**Root Cause:**
The update function was incorrectly backing up ALL directories in `USER_DATA_DIRECTORIES`, including:

- `node_modules` (managed by package managers, contains symlinks)
- `.git` (managed by git)
- `dist`, `build`, `coverage`, `.next`, `.nuxt`, `out` (build artifacts)

These directories should be **excluded** from operations, not backed up. The only directories that need backup are those spec-flow manages and users customize.

**Solution:**
Separated concerns with two constants:

1. **`USER_DATA_DIRECTORIES`** - Directories to EXCLUDE from install/copy operations
2. **`BACKUP_DIRECTORIES`** - Directories to back up during updates (only `specs` + `.spec-flow/memory`)

Now updates only back up truly valuable user data:

- `.spec-flow/memory` (roadmap, constitution, design inspirations)
- `specs` (feature specifications)

### 🎯 Impact

- ✅ Updates work on Windows without admin privileges
- ✅ No EPERM errors from symlink operations
- ✅ Faster updates (not backing up massive node_modules)
- ✅ Cleaner backups (only valuable user data)
- ✅ Works with pnpm, npm, yarn equally well

### 📝 Files Changed

- **bin/install.js**: Added `BACKUP_DIRECTORIES` constant, updated backup/restore logic (3 locations)
- **package.json**: Version bump to 1.6.2

### 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install -g spec-flow@1.6.2
```

Or upgrade:

```bash
npm update -g spec-flow
```

## v1.6.1 (2025-10-16)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Improved Brownfield Project Onboarding

**Problem:**
Running `npx spec-flow init` in brownfield projects with existing `.claude` or `.spec-flow` directories would fail with an unhelpful error message, forcing users to manually discover and run `npx spec-flow update`. This created a poor onboarding experience where the installation wizard felt "just for show."

**Solution:**
The `init` command now intelligently detects existing installations and seamlessly guides users through the update process:

**Interactive Mode:**

- Detects existing Spec-Flow installation
- Shows current installation status (`.claude`, `.spec-flow` directories)
- Prompts user: "Update existing installation (recommended)" or "Cancel"
- Automatically runs update workflow with proper backups
- Displays clear next steps after successful update

**Non-Interactive Mode:**

- Auto-detects existing installation
- Automatically runs update without user intervention
- Perfect for CI/CD pipelines and automation scripts

**Before:**

```bash
$ npx spec-flow init
✗ Already installed. Use update command or remove existing installation.
# User forced to know about separate update command
```

**After (Interactive):**

```bash
$ npx spec-flow init
⚠ Spec-Flow is already installed in this directory
  .claude directory: ✓
  .spec-flow directory: ✓

? What would you like to do?
  ❯ Update existing installation (recommended) - Preserves your data
    Cancel installation

✓ Update complete!

Next steps:
  1. Open project in Claude Code
  2. Run /roadmap to plan features
  3. Run /spec-flow "feature-name" to start building
```

**After (Non-Interactive):**

```bash
$ npx spec-flow init --non-interactive
Auto-updating existing installation...
✓ Update complete!
```

### 📝 Files Changed

- **bin/install-wizard.js**: Added early installation detection and guided update flow
- **bin/install.js**: Improved error messages with actionable guidance
- **package.json**: Version bump to 1.6.1

### 🎯 Impact

- ✅ Brownfield projects can now use `init` command without being blocked
- ✅ Non-interactive mode (CI/automation) auto-updates seamlessly
- ✅ Users get clear, actionable guidance instead of cryptic errors
- ✅ Onboarding is fully functional, not "just for show"

### 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install -g spec-flow@1.6.1
```

Or upgrade from 1.6.0:

```bash
npm update -g spec-flow
```

- Batch migration utility: `.spec-flow/scripts/bash/migrate-state-to-yaml.sh`
- Originals preserved as `.json.backup`
- Schema version: 1.0.0 → 2.0.0

**Prerequisites:**

- `yq` v4.0+ (replaces `jq` for YAML processing)
- PowerShell: `powershell-yaml` module

#### Roadmap Integration

**What's New:**

- Automatic roadmap lifecycle tracking throughout workflow
- `/spec-flow` command marks features as "In Progress"
- `/ship` command marks features as "Shipped" with metadata
- Feature discovery system during implementation
