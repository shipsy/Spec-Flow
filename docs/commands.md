## Core Commands

Core orchestration commands for feature development workflows.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/feature [description\|slug\|continue\|next\|epic:<name>\|epic:<name>:sprint:<num>\|sprint:<num>]` | Execute feature development workflow from specification through production deployment with automated quality gates and manual approval checkpoints |
| `/quick <description>` | Implement small bug fixes and features (<100 LOC) without full workflow. Use for single-file changes, bug fixes, refactors, and minor enhancements that can be completed in under 30 minutes. |
| `/help [verbose]` | Analyze workflow state and provide context-aware guidance with visual progress indicators and recommended next steps |
| `/route-agent [task description]` | Analyze task and route to specialist agent (backend, frontend, database, qa, debugger, or reviewer) using scoring algorithm and shared routing rules |

**Usage Example:**

```bash
# Start a new feature
/feature "Add dark mode toggle to user settings"

# Quick fix
/quick "Fix typo in welcome message"

# Resume current feature
/feature continue

# Get workflow guidance
/help
```

---

## Phase Commands

Individual workflow phases - can be run standalone or via `/feature` orchestration.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/spec <feature-description> [--interactive] [--yes] [--skip-clarify]` | Generate complete feature specification with research, requirements analysis, and quality gates |
| `/clarify [spec-identifier or empty for auto-detect]` | Reduce spec ambiguity via targeted questions with adaptive auto-invocation (planning is 80% of success) |
| `/plan [feature-name or epic-slug]` | Generate implementation plan from spec using research-driven design (meta-prompting for epics) |
| `/tasks [--ui-first]` | Generate TDD task breakdown from plan.md with test-first sequencing and mockup-first mode (--ui-first) |
| `/validate [feature-slug] [--quick\|--constitution]` | Analyze spec, plan, and tasks for consistency violations, breaking changes, and constitution compliance. Generates analysis-report.md with CRITICAL/MAJOR/MINOR findings. |
| `/implement [feature-slug]` | Execute all implementation tasks from tasks.md with test-driven development, parallel batching, and atomic commits |
| `/test [feature-slug] [--type=unit\|integration\|e2e\|all] [--coverage] [--watch]` | Run test suite with optional filtering by type. Defaults to all tests. Supports coverage validation and watch mode for TDD. |
| `/optimize [feature-slug or empty for auto-detection]` | Run parallel quality gates (performance, security, accessibility, code review, migrations, Docker) and block deployment on failures |
| `/debug [feature-slug] [options]` | Execute systematic debugging workflow via spec-cli.py, track failures in error-log.md, and generate session reports |
| `/finalize` | Finalize documentation (CHANGELOG, README, help docs), update GitHub milestones/releases, and cleanup branches after production deployment |

**Usage Example:**

```bash
# Create specification
/spec "User authentication with OAuth 2.1"

# Clarify ambiguities
/clarify

# Generate implementation plan
/plan

# Break down into tasks (with UI-first mockups)
/tasks --ui-first

# Validate consistency
/validate

# Implement
/implement

# Run tests (quick feedback during development)
/test --type=unit

# Run all tests (before commit)
/test

# Run quality gates
/optimize

# Finalize after deployment
/finalize
```

## Epic Commands

Multi-sprint workflows for complex features (>16 hours, multiple subsystems).

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/epic [epic description \| slug \| continue \| next]` | Execute multi-sprint epic workflow from interactive scoping through deployment with parallel sprint execution and self-improvement |
| `/implement-epic [epic-slug]` | Execute multiple sprints in parallel based on dependency graph from sprint-plan.xml for epic workflows |

**Usage Example:**

```bash
# Start an epic
/epic "User authentication with OAuth 2.1"

# Resume epic
/epic continue

# Implement epic sprints in parallel
/implement-epic auth-system
```

**When to use `/epic` vs `/feature`:**

- Use `/epic` for: >16 hours, multiple subsystems, 2-5 sprints, >5 API endpoints, >3 database tables
- Use `/feature` for: ≤16 hours, single subsystem, 1 sprint, ≤5 endpoints, ≤3 tables
